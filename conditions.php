            General Terms and Conditions of DokuMe IN, Subhas Avenue by lane, Ranaghat,Nadia, WEST BENGAL, 741201 (here in after referred to as "DokuMe").
            <br>
            <br> This website is operated by DokuMe. If you use DokuMe services, the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions ("GTC") of DokuMe apply.
            <br>DokuMe is an online Platform for professional and individual training management
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Eligible users</b>
            <br>
            <br> Customers within the meaning of the preamble can only be natural persons who have reached the age of 18 and have full legal capacity; minors and persons with limited legal capacity require the consent of their legal representatives to use Dokume's offers. As additional service providers, only entrepreneurs, ie natural or legal persons or partnerships or associations with legal capacity, who, when concluding a legal transaction, act in the exercise of their commercial or independent professional or charitable activities, are entitled to conclude a contract with DokuMe.
            <br>The contract with DokuMe for the use of the online platform is concluded when the user completes the online registration process and uses the activation link in the confirmation e-mail sent by DokuMe (hereinafter "registration"). By registering, the user assures that he is an eligible user in accordance with these GTC. Furthermore, the user is obliged to provide truthful and complete information about the data collected during registration. The user must also always provide a current e-mail address, which is also used for communication between the user and DokuMe. If the data collected changes after registration, the customer must update this in his account immediately. With successful registration, DokuMe provides the user with an account.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Account and User Profile</b>
            <br>
            <br> With successful registration, the user receives an account. Within this, the user can create his own profile. Each user may only create one account or user profile as a customer and one account or user profile as a service provider. The account or user profile is protected by a user name and password (hereinafter "login data"), which are specified during registration. The user must ensure that his login data is not accessible to third parties. If the login data is lost or if there is a suspicion that a third party has knowledge of it or is using the user's account, the user is obliged to inform DokuMe immediately and to change his login data.
            <br>The user assures that the data used to create his account or user profile is correct and complete. The user is obliged to immediately change any changes to his account and profile data in his account or user profile on the online platform. The account or user profile is user-specific and may not be transferred to a third party without the express consent of DokuMe. The user is obliged to back up all data (e.g. profile data, project descriptions, offers, etc.) that he uses in connection with the use of DokuMe to the required extent on a daily basis.

            <br>
            <br> withdrawal
            <br>
            <br> You have the right to withdraw from this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason. The period begins after receipt of this instruction in text form, but not before the conclusion of the contract and not before fulfillment of our information obligations according to Article 246 § 2 EGBGB in connection with § 1 Para. 1 and 2 of these General Terms and Conditions, as well as our obligations according to § 312e Para. 1 Sentence 1 BGB in connection with Article 246 § 3 EGBGB.

            <br>Email: <a href="mailto:info@dokume.in" style="color: #444;">info@dokume.in</a>
            <br>
            <br> by means of a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or email) of your decision to withdraw from this contract. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send the communication regarding your exercise of the right of cancellation before the cancellation period has expired.
            <br>
            <br> Expiration of the right of withdrawal
            <br>
            <br> The consumer hereby expressly agrees that the entrepreneur can start the performance of the contract before the end of the cooling-off period and hereby confirms that he is aware that this consent means that he loses his right of withdrawal as soon as the performance of the contract has started.
            <br>
            <br> According to § 312 g II BGB, the right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts for the delivery of goods that are not prefabricated and for the production of which an individual selection or determination by the consumer is decisive or which are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer.
            <br>
            <br> End of the statutory cancellation policy
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Warranty and liability</b>
            <br>DokuMe endeavors to offer trouble-free operation of the online platform and users access to the stored data. Naturally, this is limited to services that DokuMe has an influence on. However, the user acknowledges that a complete, uninterrupted availability of DokuMe is technically not feasible. However, DokuMe endeavors to keep the online platform available as permanently as possible. There is no entitlement to this. In particular, DokuMe is at liberty to restrict access to the online platform in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently, due to maintenance work, capacity issues and events that are beyond DokuMe's sphere of influence. There is also no entitlement for individual users to maintain individual functionalities and services of DokuMe.
            <br>In the case of slight negligence, DokuMe is only liable for the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations), whereby liability in this case is limited to the amount of the foreseeable damage that is typical for the contract. Otherwise, the pre-contractual, contractual and non-contractual liability of DokuMe is limited to intent and gross negligence as well as to damage resulting from injury to life, limb or health. Liability for damage that occurs despite the assumption of a guarantee for the quality of the work and liability under the ProdHaftG remain unaffected. The limitation of liability also applies if one of DokuMe's vicarious agents is at fault.
            <br>
            <br> In the event of legal problems arising in connection with a service contract, the user must send the service contract partner an appropriate statement of claim or complaint via the help function of DokuMe before conducting arbitration or court proceedings to let. The service contract partner is granted a 15-day period to comment and resolve the conflict. Arbitration or court proceedings may only be initiated by the person concerned after this period has expired.
            <br>
            <br> Final Provisions India Standard Time (GMT+5:30) applies to all times, periods and deadlines.
            <br>
            <br> The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies to the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention (CISG). The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from and in connection with this contract, regardless of the legal basis, is Cologne. Data protection
